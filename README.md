# mini-message-board
Project to learn Express.js and EJS.

When making this project, i had to:
- create server
- set "public" directory for static files
- create root and /new routes
- create route with parameters
- create views
- deploy

After learning a bit about data handling and PostgreSQL, i came back to this project and added some more stuff:
- Create pool with node-postgres using enviroment variables (dotenv)
- Create functions for database queries
- Add router and controller
- Update views

Then, i set up a database on Render and populate it using the db/populatedb.js script.
